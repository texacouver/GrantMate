# Grant Proposal: Youth Technology Education Program

## Executive Summary

Community Learning Center respectfully requests $75,000 over 12 months to implement 
the Youth Technology Education Program. This innovative initiative addresses critical 
needs within underserved youth ages 14-18 by providing comprehensive technology training, 
coding workshops, and career development opportunities.

Our organization's mission is to bridge the digital divide and provide equal access 
to technology education for all community members. Through this project, we will

## Statement of Need

The target population of underserved youth ages 14-18 faces significant challenges 
that require immediate intervention. Current data indicates a substantial gap in 
technology education services, with limited resources available to address these 
pressing needs.

Research demonstrates that targeted technology interventions similar to our proposed 
project yield measurable improvements in career readiness and educational outcomes. 
The urgency of this need cannot be overstated, as delays in implementation result 
in continued educational inequality for those we aim to serve.

**Specific Measurable Outcomes:**
- Serve a minimum of 100 youth participants annually
- Achieve 85% program completion rates
- Establish partnerships with 5 local technology organizations
- Place 75% of graduates in internships or advanced education programs

## Budget Justification

The requested $75,000 will be allocated strategically:

**Personnel (60% - $45,000):**
- Program Director (1.0 FTE)
- Technology Instructors (2.0 FTE)
- Support Staff (0.5 FTE)

**Equipment & Technology (25% - $18,750):**
- Laptops and tablets for student use
- Software licenses and development tools
- Networking and infrastructure upgrades

**Administrative Costs (15% - $11,250):**
