# Grant Proposal: Youth Technology Education Program

## Executive Summary

Community Learning Center respectfully requests $75,000 over 12 months to implement 
the Youth Technology Education Program. This innovative initiative addresses critical 
needs within underserved youth ages 14-18 by providing comprehensive technology training, 
coding workshops, and career development opportunities.

Our organization's mission is to bridge the digital divide and provide equal access

## Statement of Need

The target population of underserved youth ages 14-18 faces significant challenges 
that require immediate intervention. Current data indicates a substantial gap in 
technology education services, with limited resources available to address these 
pressing needs.

- Achieve 85% program completion rates
- Establish partnerships with 5 local technology organizations
- Place 75% of graduates in internships or advanced education programs

## Budget Justification

The requested $75,000 will be allocated strategically:

**Personnel (60% - $45,000):**
- Program Director (1.0 FTE)
- Technology Instructors (2.0 FTE)
- Support Staff (0.5 FTE)

**Equipment & Technology (25% - $18,750):**
- Laptops and tablets for student use
